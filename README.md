•	**How do I approach designing software?** ***What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? What design process did you follow for your project work? How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?***<br><br>
       &emsp;This project was worked from a 2D sketch that I wanted to bring to life. Using this design as a starting point allowed me to determine which shapes would best suit my objects. From here, I created a function that would be used to create the multiple objects. With each milestone, more features were added to the scene until the product was complete. This process allowed me to address issues as they arose and is a useful approach while working in development. <br>
        
•	**How do I approach developing programs?** ***What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? How did iteration factor into your development? How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?***<br><br>
        &emsp;Iterations and persistence played a big role in this project’s development. Since OpenGL was completely new to me there was a lot of trial and error. Each iteration helped me to better understand how the parts were interacting. I found that with each milestone, the new content helped solidify what I had learned. It also allowed me to clean up some of the messier code, so it was more efficient and easier to read. Sticking to the strategy of focusing on one function at a time was a part of this success.
      
        
•	**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?** ***How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational and/or professional pathway?***<br><br>
                  &emsp;Computational graphics and visualizations were really a culmination of all the math and computing courses I've taken so far. It was a truly rewarding experience to utilize all these skills to create a 3D world all my own. The confidence I gained is invaluable as I more forward on my professional and educational path.
